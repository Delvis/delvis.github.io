Project done in less than a day for official submission in the online course <a href = "https://www.coursera.org/course/devdataprod" target = "_blank">Developing Data Products</a> from the Johns Hopkins University. I also had to submit an online presentation fully programmed in R, that you can can check <a href = "http://rpubs.com/Del/cranExplrDeck" target = "_blank">here</a>.

## rASUDAS

<a href = "https://dsnavega.shinyapps.io/r-asudas-app/" target = "_blank">Click here to try rASUDAS!</a>

Coming from a collaborative effort with <a href = "https://github.com/dsnavega"  target = "_blank">David Navega</a> and <a href = "http://www.unr.edu/anthropology/people/faculty/g-richard-scott" target = "_blank">G. Richard Scott</a> that was born during the <a href = "http://www.uc.pt/fctuc/dcv/eventos/2015/IIbam" target = "_blank">II Bioanthropological Meeting</a> (Coimbra, Portugal). Together, we will revolutionize the field of dental morphology while creating a very useful new tool for ancestry estimation. The current version is a very early prototype - but already fully functional. Soon, we will update it with a far larger database and optimized algorithm, and provide also an offline exectuable version.
