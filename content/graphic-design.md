For as long as memory allows me to dive in I've had an inordinate fondness for drawing and playing around with illustration software.


## osteomics

<img src="/images/osteomicsLogo.png" alt="headr-logo">

My most personal project, <a href = "http://osteomics.com" target = "_blank">osteomics</a> is a business dedicated to addressing issues in osteology. The logo was initially hand-drawn by me and later vectorized using Illustrator. I am particularly pleased with the website, which I crafted solely using **R** and the web-page rendering capabilities of the **rmarkdown** package.

<img src="/images/osteomicsPage.png" alt="page">

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="/images/osteomicsLogo2.png" alt="logo"></td>
    <td><img src="/images/osteomics_favicon.png" alt="head"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Landpage; logotype; and favicon.


Osteomics is a project with the goal of simplifying and making osteology tools accessible to a wider audience.

In 2016 and 2017 I was the web designer at the <a href = "http://jest.pt" target = "_blank">Junior Enterprise for Science and Tech</a>. One of my main roles in JEST was to create a powerful brand image for the association.


<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="/images/jestPage.jpg" alt="first iteration of JEST website screeshot"></td>
    <td><img src="/images/jestLogo_coresB.png" alt="Jest Logo"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

jest.pt first iteration of the web site. Logotype concept uses the < > visual from the coding community while creating a double Diamonds aesthetics (JESTer), plus it also mimics the DNA Code visual models (all founding members were from the Life Sciences Department, UC).

## Laboratory of Forensic Anthropology

I have proposed 4 different logotypes to the LFA. The last one was their favourite.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="/images/LoFA1.png" alt="1"></td>
    <td><img src="/images/LoFA2.png" alt="2"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="/images/LoFA3.png" alt="3"></td>
    <td><img src="/images/LoFA4.png" alt="4"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

A) Vitruvian Skeleton; B) Spreading Caliper; C) 4 Pillars of biological profiling (being used now at Osteomics with slight alterations); D) Cranium network (had the most votes; was chosen by the LFA team


I am also the creator and manager of the lab's website. Visit <a href = "http://lfa.uc.pt" target = "_blank">lfa.uc.pt</a>

# Pixel Art

When I was around 14~15 years old I collaborated in the development of amateur RPG (Role-Playing Games) international projects, including a Pokémon fan-game.

I also made a huge tileset with Pokémon graphics compatible with RPG Maker XP, you can download <a href = "http://jcoelho.com/images/pixelart/tileset.png" target = "_blank">it here</a>, it will take a while to load.
