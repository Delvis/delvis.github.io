Just wanted to announce that we have published a new scientific article: <a href = "http://www.fsijournal.org/article/S0379-0738(16)30263-8/abstract" target="_blank">Curate et al. 2016</a>: "A method for sex estimation using the proximal femur" on **Forensic Science International**. Again this is a collaborative work with some members from the <a href = "http://lfa.uc.pt/" target = "_blank">Laboratory of Forensic Anthropology</a>.

Some highlights from the article:

+ Models to estimate sex in incomplete and fragmentary human skeletal remains.
+ Simple and straightforward measurements in the proximal portion of the femur.
+ Femoral neck axis length and femoral neck width show sexual dimorphism.
+ A decision tree with both variables gives the most accurate and less biased results.

**DOI:** <a href = "http://www.fsijournal.org/article/S0379-0738(16)30263-8/abstract" target="_blank">http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2016.06.011</a>

I've also built a simple app that allows easy implementation of the method, <a href = "http://osteomics.com/SeuPF" target = "_blank">SeuPF</a>. Try it!

The method for sex estimation only needs two simple femoral measurements to work.

Besides, on a brief note, I'd also like to bring attention to <a href = "http://cias.uc.pt" target = "_blank">CIAS - Centro de Investigação em Antropologia e Saúde</a> (Research Centre of Anthropology and Health) and its new face, cleaner design and web address. This was a very challenging project that I loved to be part of. Please visit it:
