Congrats to me!

I have finally finished a full tree of knowledge in Duolingo. This means there are not any new games for me to try, with this language in specific, in the platform. Yet, Danish sure is a difficult language, while I can somewhat read it now, it's still really hard to understand by listening. I've watched a few series and listened to a few audiobooks to improve that, yet...

No doubts, one of my favorite sites on the web. Knowledge offered for free is the greatest thing ever!
