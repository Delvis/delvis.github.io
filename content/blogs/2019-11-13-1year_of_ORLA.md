## ORLA - MASS

<a href="https://orla.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">**ORLA**</a> is an etheral entity that emerged either within the depthness of blackholes or in the throat of Cthulhu eons ago.


Exactly 1 year ago, ORLA released an ambient sci-fi inspired project titled <a href="https://orla.bandcamp.com/album/mass" target="_blank">**MASS**</a>, a cyclical exploratory journey through another universe. While mass increases, time does not exist: the journey never ends.
