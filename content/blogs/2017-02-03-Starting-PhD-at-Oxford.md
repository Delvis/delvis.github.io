Yo yo,

Recently I got two excellent news!

Around the end of last year I wrote a research proposal for a DPhil in Anthropology at Oxford University. Last week I was delighted to get an offer letter from their School of Anthropology. My research will be in the area of **Geospatial Paleoanthropology**, meaning using remote sensing to discover potential hot spots of fossil human ancestors. Plus, I got an excellent supporting team as well! Professor Susana Carvalho as my supervisor and Professor Robert Anemone and Professor Eugénia Cunha as my co-supervisors.

This week the official results of the <a href="http://fct.pt" href="_blank">Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</a> grants also come out. For me, it was positive! Which was awesome, unexpected good news. This scholarship will help me pay my studies and my life for the next 3 or 4 years in England.
