Yo folks,

Recently I launched in collaboration with a few friends the <a href = "http://jest.pt" target = "_blank">jest.pt</a> website. JEST promotes a startup-like environment for young academics, mainly from the **Life Sciences Department** at the University of Coimbra. We are a junior association that develops data science solutions in bioinformatics, forensic, and health sciences. We are committed to learn by doing and as a team.

Our first project is *R Attack*, a workshop about the R Statistical Language that we will be giving during 4 days. You can read more about it here: <a href = "http://jest.pt/2016/11/01/R.html" target = "_blank">R Attack</a>. It goes from completely beginner's material to very advanced topics, such as optimization of written functions, but without any sudden jumps. We will try to keep things simple, so that all the course is accessible even for people with no background whatsoever in programming.

| DAY 1 - R for dummies | DAY 2 - R for data nerds | DAY 3 - R for hackers | DAY 4 - R for programmers |
|:--------|:-------:|--------:|--------:|
| Intro to R and R Studio | From raw data to tidy data (tidyr and dplyr) | Reporting with R Markdown | The apply family |
| Importing data | Exploring: base plot vs. ggplot2 | Intro to Shiny: Web-app development | Function writing |
| Basic operations and loops | Intro to Machine Learning with caret | Interactive plotting | Advanced R programming |
| Descriptive and Inferential stats | Open data, online collaboration and sharing | Intro to R efficiency | Data science workflow |

There will be a different speaker each day and I will be responsible for the 3rd day. My current role in JEST is as head of design, webmaster and workshop speaker.
