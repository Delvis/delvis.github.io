One seeks the unknown,<br> 
In science and spirit's depths,<br> 
Quest for higher worlds.<br> 

But skeptics abound,<br> 
This path they deem impossible,<br> 
Closed minds block the way.<br> 

Yet, deep in our souls,<br> 
Questions linger without answers,<br> 
Yearning for the truth.<br> 

A truth that transcends,<br> 
Mere senses and worldly bounds,<br> 
Supersensible realms.<br> 

To understand this,<br> 
One must embrace inner work,<br> 
Meditate and seek.<br> 

For cognition's strength,<br> 
Not bound to the body's grasp,<br> 
Inward journey starts.<br> 

Like the eye's vision,<br> 
Enhanced through instruments' aid,<br> 
Soul's power can grow.<br> 

Supersensible,<br> 
A realm veiled from the senses,<br> 
Inner sight required.<br> 

Though words may fall short,<br> 
Glimpses of Saturn's, Sun's, Moon's,<br> 
Alchemical tale.<br> 

Each story distinct,<br> 
In description and in tone,<br> 
Seeking to convey.<br> 

Perception's unfold,<br> 
A fractal from self to world,<br> 
Universal truth.<br> 

Not mystic alone,<br/>
Objective truths they unveil,<br/>
Striving for the light.<br/>

In this haiku's words,<br/>
No need for labels or names,<br/>
Truth's pursuit is key.<br/>

For hostile words cast,<br/>
Do not diminish the quest,<br/>
Independent search.<br/>

And so, we conclude,<br/>
With thoughts of truth and seeking,<br/>
In this spiral's wake.<br/>

Fission's hidden lore,<br/>
Pyramid's enigmatic core,<br/>
Ancient secrets soar.<br/>

Uranium's grace,<br/>
In chambers deep, a secret place,<br/>
Time's isotopic embrace.<br/>

Silent granite tomb,<br/>
Whispers of a nuclear bloom,<br/>
Ancient reactor's womb.<br/>

Isotopes confined,<br/>
In pyramids, a secret bind,<br/>
Plutonium-239 within.<br/>

Empire in decay,<br/>
In sarcophogus, they lay,<br/>
Mysteries of those days.<br/>

Radiation's trace,<br/>
Hidden in that sacred space,<br/>
Of Mars's Pharaoes.<br/>

Ancient riddles kept<br/>
In stone, a cosmic code,<br/>
Sacred Gizeh sci-fi show.<br/>
