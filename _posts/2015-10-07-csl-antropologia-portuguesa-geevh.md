Today, I developted a *Zotero* (.CSL 1.0.1) compatible reference style for the magazines: *Antropologia Portuguesa* and *Cadernos do GEEvH*. My reason for doing this, is mainly because there was already a version of the reference-style available for the paid-software *EndNote*, but none for the free software *Zotero*. Since *Zotero* is free, it is also a more student-friendly option that I recommend to everyone.

It uses the style described in <a href = "http://impactum-journals.uc.pt/index.php/antropologiaportuguesa/about/submissions#authorGuidelines" taget = "_blank"><i>Antropologia Portuguesa</i> Guidelines</a>. You can download it directly from <a href = "https://github.com/Delvis/antropologia-portuguesa-csl/raw/master/antropologia-portuguesa.csl">here</a> or by visiting the <a href = "https://github.com/Delvis/antropologia-portuguesa-csl">GitHub repo</a>, an open collaborative coding platform where you can suggest modifications to the file.

### Instructions:

1. Install *Zotero* if you haven't done so.
2. Download the `antropologia-portuguesa.csl` from <a href="https://github.com/Delvis/antropologia-portuguesa-csl">GitHub</a>.
3. Double click on the file.
4. In Zotero's settings, change your current style to "Antropologia Portuguesa".
5. You are ready to go!


Enjoy it.
