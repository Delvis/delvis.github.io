Congrats to me!

I have finally finished a full tree of knowledge in Duolingo. This means there a not any new games in the platform for me to try with this language in specific. Yet, Danish sure is a difficult language, while I can somewhat read it now, it's still really hard to understand by listening. I've watched a few series and listened to a few audiobooks to improve that, yet...
