Foreword

Today commemorates the 15<sup>th</sup> anniversary of *Bitcoin's White Paper* <a href = "https://www.jcoelho.com/reports/bitcoin.pdf" target="_blank">[1]</a>, a seminal document that seeks to delineate a protocol for the separation of Money and State. Interestingly, this day also coincides with the 506<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Martin Luther's posting his *Ninety-Five Theses* (“Disputation on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences”) <a href = "https://www.luther.de/en/95thesen.html" target="_blank">[2]</a> on the door of the Castle Church in Wittenberg, which played a pivotal role in the separation of Church and State. The 31<sup>st</sup> of October is also the day of Samhain, Halloween, and the start of the 3-day celebrations of *Dia de Los Muertos* in Mexico. It’s hard to fathom that such synchronicity is a pure coincidence, since the transition from late October to early November marks the peak of the Taurid meteor stream. This cyclical period must have—since times immemorial—historically coincided with disaster, catastrophe, and death. As such, it's a fitting day to hope to better tomorrows, seek lasting change and, God-willing, rebirth.

Happy birthday Bitcoin!
