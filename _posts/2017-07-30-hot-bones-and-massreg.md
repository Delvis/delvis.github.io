## HOT BONES


I am very pleased to announce that the HOT team has a new site:

The coolest thing I learned when developing HOT BONES was to create this beauties, using only the R programming language and a simple sheet from Excel.

## Dead Weight paper is out

Besides, we published recently, with some of the team members a new paper, *Dead Weight: validation of mass regression equations on experimentally burned skeletal remains to assess skeleton completeness*, on <a href="http://www.scienceandjusticejournal.com" target="_blank">Science and Justice</a>. It tests the <a href="http://osteomics.com/MassReg" target="_blank">MassReg app</a> on the experimentally burned skeletons of the CEIXXI available at <a href="http://lfa.uc.pt" target="_blank">Laboratory of Forensic Anthropology, UC</a>. Despite MassReg being initially developed for non-burned skeletal remains, it seems to perform as well on burned skeletal remains as other techniques (e.g. comparing to references). Thus it is a new promising and useful tool to assess skeletal completeness.

Congrats to all involved!
