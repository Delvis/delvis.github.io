Yo folks.

It's time for some more show off! Here is my latest project:


<a href = "http://lfa.uc.pt" target = "_blank">LFA.UC.PT</a>

For this project I had to develop a lot of stuff. First there was no identity image associated to the lab. First thing first, I proposed the following logotype, which was accepted by the majority of the lab team:


<figure>
	<a href = "http://lfa.uc.pt" target = "_blank"><img src="http://jcoelho.com/images/LogoLFAUC-no_band_transparent.png"/></a>
	<figcaption>Logo</figcaption>
</figure>

I had to develop a few more neat visuals as you can see in the Projects section. Next, I started working in this beauty:

  
<figure>
	<a href = "http://lfa.uc.pt" target = "_blank"><img src="http://jcoelho.com/images/LFA-websitedesign.png"/></a>
	<figcaption>Site Printscreen</figcaption>
</figure>

There's a lot of info about our lab there, including news, events, members CVs, how to collaborate with us, among others. Give <a href = "http://lfa.uc.pt" target = "_blank">lfa.uc.pt</a> a visit!

Untz!
