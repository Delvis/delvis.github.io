I"9<p>Yo folks.</p>

<p>It’s time for some more show off! Here is my latest project:</p>

<p><a href="http://lfa.uc.pt" target="_blank">LFA.UC.PT</a></p>

<p>For this project I had to develop a lot of stuff. First, there was no identity image associated to the lab. So I had to start by proposing the following logotype that was readily accepted by the majority of the lab team:</p>

<p>Next, I had to develop a few more neat visuals as you can see in the Projects section. Last, I started working in this beauty:</p>

<p>There’s a lot of info about our lab there, including news, events, members CVs, how to collaborate with us, among others. Give <a href="http://lfa.uc.pt" target="_blank">lfa.uc.pt</a> a visit!</p>

<p>Untz!</p>
