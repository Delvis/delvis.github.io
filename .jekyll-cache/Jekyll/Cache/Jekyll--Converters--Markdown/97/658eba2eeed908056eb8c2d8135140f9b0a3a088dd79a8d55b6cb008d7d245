I"é<p>Hi everyone,</p>

<p>So this is one of those really cool things that passed through my mind when I was a kid. Luckily, it is a dream I can remove from the checklist! So I appeared on a documentary on biological anthropology, more specifically about a recently discovered archaeological skeletal collection from Lagos, Portugal. This collection is unique, worldwide, in how much it can tell us about slavery related to the Age of Discovery.</p>

<p>The documentary is split into 6 episodes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The skeletons from Algarve</li>
  <li>Bioarchaeology: working with the bones</li>
  <li>History meets CSI</li>
  <li>What the teeth tell us</li>
  <li>A piece of history for the nameless</li>
  <li>The general interview with Maria Teresa Ferreira</li>
</ul>

<p>All very interesting and available in german and english, my 15 seconds of fame are mostly on the fifth one, but best is to watch all of them!</p>

<p>Yours,
j dâ€™o c</p>
