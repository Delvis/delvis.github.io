<p>I have finally finished a full tree of knowledge in Duolingo. This means there are not any new games for me to try, with this language in specific, in the platform. Yet, Danish sure is a difficult language, while I can somewhat read it now, it‚Äôs still really hard to understand by listening. I‚Äôve watched a few series and listened to a few audiobooks to improve that, yet‚Ä¶</p>
