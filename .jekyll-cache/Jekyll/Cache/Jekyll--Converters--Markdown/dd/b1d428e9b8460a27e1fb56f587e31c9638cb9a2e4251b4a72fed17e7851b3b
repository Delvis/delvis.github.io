I"<p>Today, I created a Zotero and Mendeley (.CSL 1.0.1) compatible reference style for the scientific magazines: <em>Antropologia Portuguesa</em> and <em>Cadernos do GEEvH</em>. My reason for doing this, is mainly because even though there was already an online version of this reference-style, it was only available for the paid-software EndNote. Since Zotero is free, it is definitely a more student-friendly option that I recommend to everyone. In the same spirit, I am sharing this for free to whoever might want or need it.</p>

<p>This .csl file uses the style described in <a href="http://impactum-journals.uc.pt/index.php/antropologiaportuguesa/about/submissions#authorGuidelines" taget="_blank"><i>Antropologia Portuguesa</i> Guidelines</a>. You can download it directly from <a href="https://github.com/Delvis/antropologia-portuguesa-csl/raw/master/antropologia-portuguesa.csl" target="_blank">here</a> or by visiting the <a href="https://github.com/Delvis/antropologia-portuguesa-csl" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a>, an open collaborative coding platform where you can suggest modifications to the file.</p>

<h3 id="instructions">Instructions:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Install Zotero if you haven’t done so.</li>

  <li>Double click on the file.</li>
