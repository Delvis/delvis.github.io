<p>Yo folks,</p>

<p>Recently I launched in collaboration with a few friends the <a href="http://jest.pt" target="_blank">jest.pt</a> website. JEST promotes a startup-like environment for young academics, mainly from the <strong>Life Sciences Department</strong> at the University of Coimbra. We are a junior association that develops data science solutions in bioinformatics, forensic, and health sciences. We are committed to learn by doing and as a team.</p>

<p>Our first project is <strong>R Attack</strong>, a workshop about the R Statistical Language that we will be giving during 4 days. You can read more about it here: <a href="http://jest.pt/2016/11/01/R.html" target="_blank">R Attack</a>. It goes from completely beginner’s material to very advanced topics, such as optimization of written functions. However, we will try to keep things simple, so that all the course is accessible even for people with no background whatsoever in programming.</p>

<p><strong>DAY 1 - R for dummies</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Intro to R and R Studio</li>
  <li>Importing data</li>
