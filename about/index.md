Howdy! I am João, a self-taught programmer from Coimbra, Portugal. Everyday I use most of my synapses to tackle problems that interest me in business and science.

You can see my academic curriculum in the <a href = "http://www.degois.pt/visualizador/curriculum.jsp?key=3783104624248545" target = "_blank">DeGóis platform</a>.
