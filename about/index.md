Howdy! I am Jo√£o, a young self-taught programmer from Coimbra, Portugal. On a day to day basis I use most of my synapses to tackle problems that interest me in business and science.

## Check for yourself the webapps I've been developing:

* [MassReg](https://joao.shinyapps.io/MassReg)
* [cranExplr](https://joao.shinyapps.io/cranExplr/)
* [hefneR](https://joao.shinyapps.io/hefner-app) 

Lately I've also been working in this awesome projects:

* [rASUDAS](https://dsnavega.shinyapps.io/r-asudas-app/)
* [AncesTrees](https://dsnavega.shinyapps.io/AncesTrees)
