## Laboratory of Forensic Anthropology

<figure>
  <img src="http://jcoelho.com/images/lafLogo1.png" alt="Laboratório de Antropologia Forense">
  <figcaption>The idea was to recreate the vitruvian man concept, a Da Vinci's famous drawing. Instead using a skeleton to represent the main object of study for forensic anthropologists. This is a logo I've designed for a portuguese lab of forensic anthropology based on the University of Coimbra, Portugal.</figcaption>

## Scientific Posters

One of the stuff I enjoy the most is to design scientifc posters that are clean, minimalist and easily convey useful info to the public in conferences.
