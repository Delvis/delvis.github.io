For as long as memory allows me to dive in I've had an inordinate fondness for drawing and playing around with illustration software.

## JEST

I am a webdesigner at <a href = "http://jest.pt" target = "_blank">Junior Enterprise for Science and Tech</a>.

## Laboratory of Forensic Anthropology

I have proposed 4 different logotypes to the LFA. The last one was their favourite.

I am also the creator and manager of the lab's website. Visit <a href = "http://lfa.uc.pt" target = "_blank">lfa.uc.pt</a>

## osteomics.com

My most personal project, <a href = "http://osteomics.com" target = "_blank">osteomics</a> is a business focused in solving problems related to osteology. The logo was first hand-draw, then vectorized with a computer.

## Scientific Posters

One of the stuff I enjoy the most is to design scientific posters that are clean, minimalist and easily convey useful info to the public in conferences.

# Pixel Art

When I was around 14~15 years old I collaborated in the development of amateur RPG (Role-Playing Games) international projects, including a Pokémon fan-game.

I also made a huge tileset with Pokémon graphics compatible with RPG Maker XP, you can download <a href = "http://jcoelho.com/images/pixelart/tileset.png" target = "_blank">it here</a>, it will take a while to load.
