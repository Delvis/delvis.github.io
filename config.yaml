      I am a self-taught programmer with an academic background in biological anthropology. I graduated in Human Evolution and Biology at the University of Coimbra, while simultaneously founding <a href="https://osteomics.com" target = "_blank">osteomics</a>, where I developed several web applications.

      Later I obtained a DPhil at University of Oxford in Geospatial Paleoanthropology. Currently, I am a paleontologist at Gorongosa National Park, Mozambique.

          Studying anthropology has provided me with a integrated understanding of the social, cultural, and biological dimensions of humans. Through analysis of bones, genetics, artifacts, languages, behaviors, norms, symbols, narratives, and institutions, I've learned to interpret the complexities of cultural and biological diversity. This epistemological decentralization broadens perspectives, enabling me to understand and analyze past and present dilemmas.
